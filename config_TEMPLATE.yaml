# FAIReSheets Configuration Template 
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE. config.yaml IS THE FILE THAT IS USED BY THE CODE
# This file contains all of the options for the config.yaml file 

# Requirement levels to include in the template
# Options: M (Mandatory), HR (Highly Recommended), R (Recommended), O (Optional)
# Default: all levels included
req_lev:
  - M
  - HR
  - R
  - O

# Sample types to include in the template
# Each sample type will add different fields to the template
# Options: Water | Soil | Sediment | Air | HostAssociated | MicrobialMatBiofilm | SymbiontAssociated | other
# You can include multiple types by adding them as a list seperated by pipes
# Example: For water samples with some sediment samples:
sample_type:
  - Water | Sediment

# Assay type determines which sheets will be generated
# YOU CAN ONLY CHOOSE ONE OF THE 2 OPTIONS:
#   - metabarcoding: Generates taxaRaw, taxaFinal, experimentRunMetadata sheets
#     (Used for sequencing-based approaches like 16S/18S rRNA gene sequencing)
#
#   OR
#
#   - targeted: Generates stdData, eLowQuantData, ampData sheets
#     (Used for qPCR and similar targeted approaches)
assay_type: metabarcoding

# Project identifier (no spaces)
# Example: noaa-aoml-gomecc4
project_id: your-project-id

# Assay name(s) (no spaces)
# You can include multiple assays by adding them as separate list items
assay_name:
  - your-assay-name-1
  - your-assay-name-2

# OPTIONAl: User-defined fields for project metadata
# Add any additional fields you want to include in the metadata sheets
# These fields will be added with 'O' (Optional) requirement level
projectMetadata_user:
  - field1
  - field2

sampleMetadata_user:
  - field1
  - field2
